## How to play
* After launching the game, press the "C" key on the keyboard to enter player names. You can enter a maximum of 4 players.
* Once the names are entered, the player names will appear in the center of the screen. Each player will be assigned a unique key and color, which will also be displayed next to their names.
* If a player wants to change their assigned key or color, they can click on the respective key name or color field next to their player name.
* After the player configuration is completed, you can start the gameplay. The entire game will be played using a single computer and keyboard.
* The race will begin when you press the "Space" key. Each player will be represented on the race track by a line with their assigned color.
* During the race, the player's line will move in one direction, leaving a trail behind. The trail will disappear after completing each lap.
* The player can control their line using the assigned key. By pressing the turn key, the line will make a left turn. Remember, you can only turn left.
* The longer the player holds the turn key, the sharper the turn will be. Be careful not to hit the inner or outer edges of the track.
* The speed of each player increases with each lap, making the game more intense.
* The winner is the player who completes the most laps during the race.

**Enjoy your game and good luck in the races!**
